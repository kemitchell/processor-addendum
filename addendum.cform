    \Processing of Controller Personal Data\

        # GDPR 28(3)(a)
        \Compliant Processing\  <Processor> and each <Subprocessor> agree to:

            \\  comply with all applicable <Data Protection Law> in the <Processing> of <Controller Personal Data>; and

            \\  not <Process> <Controller Personal Data> other than on the relevant <Controller Company>'s written instructions, unless <Processing> is required by law, in which case the <Processor> or <Subprocessor> agrees to give the <Controller Company> notice of the legal requirement before <Processing>, if the law permits.

        \Instruction to Process\  Each <Controller Company> instructs <Processor>, and authorizes <Processor> and each <Subprocessor> to instruct each of their <Subprocessors>, to <Process> <Controller Personal Data> and transfer <Controller Personal Data> to any country or territory as necessary for the provision of the <Services>, consistent with the <Services Agreement>.

        \Legal Instruction Warranty\  Each <Controller Company> states that it is and will be legally authorized to give the instruction in {Instruction to Process}.

        \Required Information\  {Processing Summary} sets out information required by <GDPR> 28(3). <Controller> can make amendments to {Processing Summary} by written notice to <Processor> as necessary to meet similar requirements of other <Data Protection Law>.  Nothing in {Processing Summary} confers any right or imposes any obligation on any party to this addendum.

    # GDPR 28(3)(b)
    \Personnel\  <Processor> agrees to:

        \\  answer for breaches of this addendum by its <Personnel>, and <Personnel> of any <Subprocessor>, with access to <Controller Personal Data>;

        \\  limit access to <Controller Personal Data> to <Personnel> who need access for purposes of the <Services Agreement>, or to comply with <Data Protection Law>; and

        \\  ensure that all <Personnel> with access to <Controller Personal Data> have obligations to keep them confidential under contracts, professional obligations, or legal requirements.

    # GDPR 28(3)(c)
    \Security\  <Processor> agrees to implement the security measures listed in {Security Measures} for the protection of <Controller Personal Data>.

    \Subprocessing\

        # GDPR 28(3)(d) [authorization]
        \Appointing Subprocessors\  Each <Controller Company> authorizes <Processor> to appoint <Subprocessors>, and each of the <Subprocessors> to appoint <Subprocessors> in turn, and so on, under {Subprocessing} and any restrictions in the <Services Agreement>.

        \Current Subprocessors\  <Processor> may continue to use <Subprocessors> they were using before signing this addendum, as long as those <Subprocessors> meet the requirements of {Subprocessor Requirements} as soon as practical.

        \Notice and Objection\  <Processor> agrees to give <Controller> prior written notice of the appointment of any new <Subprocessor>, describing the <Processing> the <Subprocessor> will do.  If <Controller> gives <Processor> notice of a reasonable objection within [subprocessor objection deadline]:

            \\  <Processor> agrees to work with <Controller> to change how it provides the <Services>, to avoid using the new <Subprocessor>.

            \\  If <Processor> cannot make such a change within [subprocessor workaround deadline], <Controller> may terminate the <Services Agreement> to the extent of the <Services> that require the new <Subprocessor>.

        # GDPR 28(3)(d) [same obligations]
        \Subprocessor Requirements\  <Processor> or any <Subprocessor> appointing any new <Subprocessor> must:

            \\  perform adequate due diligence to ensure the new <Subprocessor> can provide the level of protection for <Controller Personal Data> required by the <Services Agreement> and this addendum, before that new <Subprocessor> <Processes> any <Controller Personal Data>.

            # TODO: Consider requiring the same terms.
            \\  ensure the relationship with the new <Subprocessor> is governed by a written contract:

                \\  requiring at least the same level of protection for <Controller Personal Data> as this addendum; and

                \\  meeting the requirements of <GDPR> 28(3);

            \\  ensure the <Standard Contractual Clauses> are part of the contract with the new <Subprocessor> at all times while the new <Subprocessor> <Processes> <Controller Personal Data>, if the relationship involves any <Restricted Transfer>; and

            \\  give the <Controller> review copies of the contract with the new <Subprocessor> on request, optionally redacted to remove confidential information not relevant to compliance with this addendum.

        \Subprocessor Compliance\  <Processor> agrees to ensure that each <Subprocessor> will abide by the following sections, as if the <Subprocessor> were the <Processor>, to the extent they apply to <Processing> the <Subprocessor> does:

            \\  {Compliant Processing};
            \\  {Personnel};
            # GDPR 28(3)(f) [Article 32]
            \\  {Security};
            # GDPR 28(3)(e)
            \\  {Data Subject Rights};
            # GDPR 28(3)(f) [Article 33 & 34]
            \\  {Data Breach};
            # GDPR 28(3)(f) [Article 35 & 36]
            \\  {Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation};
            \\  {Deletion or Return}; and
            # GDPR 28(3)(h)
            \\  {Audit Obligations}.

    \Data Subject Rights\

        \\  <Processor> agrees to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures listed in {Assistance Responding to Data Subject Rights} to help each <Controller Company> meet its obligation to respond to requests to exercise <Data Subject> rights under <Data Protection Law>.

        \\  <Processor> agrees to:

            \\  notify <Controller> promptly if <Processor> or any <Subprocessor> receives a request from a <Data Subject> under <Data Protection Law> about <Controller Personal Data>; and

            \\  ensure that the recipient does not respond to that request unless required by <Data Protection Law>, except on written instructions from the <Controller> or the relevant <Controller Affiliate>.

        \\  If <Data Protection Law> permits, <Processor> agrees to notify <Controller> before a <Processor> or any <Subprocessor> responds to a request because they are required to do so by <Data Protection Law>.

    \Data Breach\

        \Data Breach Notice\  <Processor> agrees to notify <Controller> without undue delay when <Processor> or any <Subprocessor> becomes aware of a <Personal Data Breach> affecting <Controller Personal Data>.  As the information becomes available, <Processor> agrees to notify <Controller> of:

            \\  the nature of the <Personal Data Breach>;

            \\  the estimated categories and number of <Data Subjects> affected;

            \\  the estimated categories and number of <Personal Data> records affected;

            \\  contact information for <Personnel> who can answer further questions; and

            \\  measures taken or planned to address the <Personal Data Breach>.

        \Data Breach Cooperation\  <Processor> agrees to cooperate with each <Controller Company> to investigate, mitigate, and remediate any <Personal Data Breach>.

    \Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation\  <Processor> agrees to assist each <Controller Company> with data protection impact assessments and prior consultations with any <Supervisory Authority> or other competent data privacy authority required by <GDPR> 35, <GDPR> 36, or similar provisions of other <Data Protection Law>, by answering questions about the <Processing> of <Controller Personal Data> by <Processor> and any <Subprocessor>.

    # GDPR 28(3)(g)
    \Deletion or Return\

        \Obligation to Delete\  Subject to {Option to Return} and {Data Retention}, <Processor> agrees to delete all copies of <Controller Personal Data>, and to require every <Subprocessor> to delete all copies, within [deletion deadline] of the <End of Services>.

        \Option to Return\  Subject to {Data Retention}, <Controller> may give <Processor> notice within [return request deadline] of the <End of Services> that <Processor> must instead return one complete copy of all <Controller Personal Data> to <Controller> by secure file transfer in standard file formats, delete other copies, and require every <Subprocessor> to delete other copies.  <Processor> agrees to return the copy requested within [return deadline] of the <End of Services>.

        \Data Retention\  <Processor> and each <Subprocessor> may retain <Controller Personal Data> as required by <Data Protection Law>.  <Processor> and each <Subprocessor> retaining <Controller Personal Data> agree to keep them confidential, and to ensure they are only <Processed> as necessary for purposes required by <Data Protection Law>.

        \Certificate of Deletion or Return\  <Processor> agrees to certify to <Controller> in writing that <Processor> and all <Subprocessors> have fully complied with {Deletion or Return} within [certification deadline] of the <End of Services>.

    \Audit\

        \Audit Obligations\  To the extent information and audit rights under the <Services Agreement> fall short of what <GDPR> 28(3)(h) and similar provisions of other <Data Protection Law> require, <Processor> agrees to:

            \\  provide information on request from any <Controller Company> to demonstrate compliance with this addendum; and

            \\  grant access for, and cooperate with, audits and inspections of compliance with this addendum by any <Controller Company> or <Controller Company> auditor.

        \Audit Procedure\

            \Notice of Audit\  Each <Controller Company> agrees to give <Processor> prior written notice of any audit or inspection under {Audit Obligations}.

            \Minimize Disruption\  Each <Controller Company> agrees to ensure that <Controller Company> <Personnel> and auditor <Personnel> take reasonable steps to avoid and minimize damage, injury, and disruption to the premises, equipment, personnel, and business of <Processor> and every <Subprocessor>.

            \Audit Limits\  Neither <Processor> nor any <Subprocessor> has to give access for an audit or inspection:

                \\  to anyone without reasonable evidence of identity or authority;

                \\  outside normal business hours, unless the <Controller Company> performing the audit gave prior notice that the audit or inspection needs to be conducted on an emergency basis; or

                \\  more than [audit frequency], not counting audits or inspections for which the <Controller Company> mentions in its notice that:

                    \\  the <Controller Company> considers the audit necessary because of concerns about compliance with this addendum;

                    \\  <Data Protection Law> requires the <Controller Company> to perform the audit; or

                    \\  a <Supervisory Authority> or similar regulatory authority responsible for enforcing <Data Protection Law> requests or requires the <Controller Company> to perform the audit.

    \Restricted Transfers\

        \Standard Contractual Clauses\  Subject to {Standard Contractual Clauses Apply Only if Necessary}, each <Controller Company> (as data exporter) and <Processor> (as data importer) agree to the <Standard Contractual Clauses> for any <Restricted Transfer> from <Controller Company> to <Processor>, substituting {Processing Summary} for appendix 1 and {Security Measures} for appendix 2 to the <Standard Contractual Clauses>.

        \Standard Contractual Clauses Apply Only if Necessary\  {Standard Contractual Clauses} applies to a <Restricted Transfer> only if necessary, together with other practical compliance steps, short of getting <Data Subjects>' consent, to make the relevant <Restricted Transfer> legal under <Data Protection Law>.

    \General Terms\

        \Governing Law and Jurisdiction\  Other than under the "Mediation and Jurisdiction" and "Governing Law" clauses of the <Standard Contractual Clauses>, the dispute resolution, venue, and forum provisions of the <Services Agreement> apply to this addendum.

        \Order of Precedence\

            \Standard Contractual Clauses Trump this Addendum\  Where this addendum and the <Standard Contractual Clauses> conflict, the <Standard Contractual Clauses> take precedence.

            \No Effect on Services Agreement Scope\  Nothing in this addendum reduces any <Processor> data protection obligations under the <Services Agreement> or permits <Processor> to <Process> or allow <Processing> of <Personal Data> in any way the <Services Agreement> prohibits.

            \This Addendum Trumps Other Agreements\  Subject to {No Effect on Services Agreement Scope}, where this addendum conflicts with other agreements between the parties, such as the <Services Agreement>, signed before or after this addendum, this addendum takes precedence.

        \Changes in Data Protection Law\

            \Amendments for Compliance\  <Controller> may amend the <Standard Contractual Clauses> as required by a change in <Data Protection Law>, or a court or regulator decision under <Data Protection Law>, to allow <Restricted Transfer> to continue without breaching <Data Protection Law>.  <Controller> must give <Processor> notice [standard contractual clauses amendment notice] in advance.

            \Amendments to Address New Risks\  If <Controller> gives notice under {Amendments for Compliance}, <Controller> agrees not to unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any amendments to this addendum proposed by <Processor> to protect <Processor> or any <Subprocessor> from additional risks posed by the amendment to the <Standard Contractual Clauses>.

            \Good Faith Negotiation\  If <Controller> gives notice under {Amendments to Address New Risks}, the parties agree to negotiate amendments to address the requirements identified in <Controller>'s notice in good faith, as soon as practical.

            \Amendment without Affiliates\  Neither <Controller> nor <Processor> needs the consent or approval of any <Affiliate> to amend this addendum, including under {Amendments to Address New Risks}.

        \Severance\  The parties intend that:

            \\  any part of this addendum held invalid or unenforceable be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable;

            \\  any part of this addendum that cannot be changed to make it enforceable be disregarded; and
