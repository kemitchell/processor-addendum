# GDPR Processor Addendum

## Be Warned!

**Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need GDPR terms for a contracting relationship, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions.  They may decide this form fits your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your work, or your clients in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.**

## Scope

These terms were prepared with the following in mind:

- GDPR data processor
- needs to meet Chapter 4 requirements
- potentially doing Chapter 5 transfers
- with separate or preexisting services agreements

That does _not_ mean these terms will work for every processor meeting those criteria.
