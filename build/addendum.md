## Processing of Controller Personal Data

<a id="compliant-processing"></a>
### Compliant Processing

_Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ agree to:

1. comply with all applicable _Data Protection Law_ in the _Processing_ of _Controller Personal Data_; and

2. not _Process_ _Controller Personal Data_ other than on the relevant _Controller Company_'s written instructions, unless _Processing_ is required by law, in which case the _Processor_ or _Subprocessor_ agrees to give the _Controller Company_ notice of the legal requirement before _Processing_, if the law permits.

<a id="instruction-to-process"></a>
### Instruction to Process

Each _Controller Company_ instructs _Processor_, and authorizes _Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ to instruct each of their _Subprocessors_, to _Process_ _Controller Personal Data_ and transfer _Controller Personal Data_ to any country or territory as necessary for the provision of the _Services_, consistent with the _Services Agreement_.

<a id="legal-instruction-warranty"></a>
### Legal Instruction Warranty

Each _Controller Company_ states that it is and will be legally authorized to give the instruction in [Instruction to Process](#instruction-to-process).

<a id="required-information"></a>
### Required Information

[Processing Summary](#processing-summary) sets out information required by _GDPR_ 28\(3\). _Controller_ can make amendments to [Processing Summary](#processing-summary) by written notice to _Processor_ as necessary to meet similar requirements of other _Data Protection Law_. Nothing in [Processing Summary](#processing-summary) confers any right or imposes any obligation on any party to this addendum.

<a id="personnel"></a>
## Personnel

_Processor_ agrees to:

1. answer for breaches of this addendum by its _Personnel_, and _Personnel_ of any _Subprocessor_, with access to _Controller Personal Data_;

2. limit access to _Controller Personal Data_ to _Personnel_ who need access for purposes of the _Services Agreement_, or to comply with _Data Protection Law_; and

3. ensure that all _Personnel_ with access to _Controller Personal Data_ have obligations to keep them confidential under contracts, professional obligations, or legal requirements.

### Appointing Subprocessors

Each _Controller Company_ authorizes _Processor_ to appoint _Subprocessors_, and each of the _Subprocessors_ to appoint _Subprocessors_ in turn, and so on, under [Subprocessing](#subprocessing) and any restrictions in the _Services Agreement_.

<a id="current-subprocessors"></a>
### Current Subprocessors

_Processor_ may continue to use _Subprocessors_ they were using before signing this addendum, as long as those _Subprocessors_ meet the requirements of [Subprocessor Requirements](#subprocessor-requirements) as soon as practical.

<a id="notice-and-objection"></a>
### Notice and Objection

_Processor_ agrees to give _Controller_ prior written notice of the appointment of any new _Subprocessor_, describing the _Processing_ the _Subprocessor_ will do. If _Controller_ gives _Processor_ notice of a reasonable objection within fourteen calendar days:

1. _Processor_ agrees to work with _Controller_ to change how it provides the _Services_, to avoid using the new _Subprocessor_.

2. If _Processor_ cannot make such a change within thirty calendar days, _Controller_ may terminate the _Services Agreement_ to the extent of the _Services_ that require the new _Subprocessor_.

<a id="subprocessor-requirements"></a>
### Subprocessor Requirements

_Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ appointing any new _Subprocessor_ must:

1. perform adequate due diligence to ensure the new _Subprocessor_ can provide the level of protection for _Controller Personal Data_ required by the _Services Agreement_ and this addendum, before that new _Subprocessor_ _Processes_ any _Controller Personal Data_.

2. ensure the relationship with the new _Subprocessor_ is governed by a written contract:

3. requiring at least the same level of protection for _Controller Personal Data_ as this addendum; and

4. meeting the requirements of _GDPR_ 28\(3\);

5. ensure the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ are part of the contract with the new _Subprocessor_ at all times while the new _Subprocessor_ _Processes_ _Controller Personal Data_, if the relationship involves any _Restricted Transfer_; and

6. give the _Controller_ review copies of the contract with the new _Subprocessor_ on request, optionally redacted to remove confidential information not relevant to compliance with this addendum.

<a id="subprocessor-compliance"></a>
### Subprocessor Compliance

_Processor_ agrees to ensure that each _Subprocessor_ will abide by the following sections, as if the _Subprocessor_ were the _Processor_, to the extent they apply to _Processing_ the _Subprocessor_ does:

1. [Compliant Processing](#compliant-processing);

2. [Personnel](#personnel);

3. [Security](#security);

2. _Processor_ agrees to:

3. notify _Controller_ promptly if _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ receives a request from a _Data Subject_ under _Data Protection Law_ about _Controller Personal Data_; and

4. ensure that the recipient does not respond to that request unless required by _Data Protection Law_, except on written instructions from the _Controller_ or the relevant _Controller Affiliate_.

5. If _Data Protection Law_ permits, _Processor_ agrees to notify _Controller_ before a _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ responds to a request because they are required to do so by _Data Protection Law_.

<a id="data-breach"></a>
## Data Breach

<a id="data-breach-notice"></a>

1. the nature of the _Personal Data Breach_;

2. the estimated categories and number of _Data Subjects_ affected;

3. the estimated categories and number of _Personal Data_ records affected;

4. contact information for _Personnel_ who can answer further questions; and

5. measures taken or planned to address the _Personal Data Breach_.

<a id="option-to-return"></a>
### Option to Return

Subject to [Data Retention](#data-retention), _Controller_ may give _Processor_ notice within fourteen calendar days of the _End of Services_ that _Processor_ must instead return one complete copy of all _Controller Personal Data_ to _Controller_ by secure file transfer in standard file formats, delete other copies, and require every _Subprocessor_ to delete other copies. _Processor_ agrees to return the copy requested within thirty calendar days of the _End of Services_.

<a id="data-retention"></a>
### Data Retention

_Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ may retain _Controller Personal Data_ as required by _Data Protection Law_. _Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ retaining _Controller Personal Data_ agree to keep them confidential, and to ensure they are only _Processed_ as necessary for purposes required by _Data Protection Law_.

<a id="certificate-of-deletion-or-return"></a>
### Certificate of Deletion or Return

<a id="audit"></a>
## Audit

<a id="audit-obligations"></a>
### Audit Obligations

To the extent information and audit rights under the _Services Agreement_ fall short of what _GDPR_ 28\(3\)\(h\) and similar provisions of other _Data Protection Law_ require, _Processor_ agrees to:

1. provide information on request from any _Controller Company_ to demonstrate compliance with this addendum; and

2. grant access for, and cooperate with, audits and inspections of compliance with this addendum by any _Controller Company_ or _Controller Company_ auditor.

<a id="audit-procedure"></a>

<a id="restricted-transfers"></a>
## Restricted Transfers

<a id="standard-contractual-clauses"></a>
### Standard Contractual Clauses

Subject to [Standard Contractual Clauses Apply Only if Necessary](#standard-contractual-clauses-apply-only-if-necessary), each _Controller Company_ \(as data exporter\) and _Processor_ \(as data importer\) agree to the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ for any _Restricted Transfer_ from _Controller Company_ to _Processor_, substituting [Processing Summary](#processing-summary) for appendix 1 and [Security Measures](#security-measures) for appendix 2 to the _Standard Contractual Clauses_.
