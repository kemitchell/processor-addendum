# Processing of Controller Personal Data

## Compliant Processing

_Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ agree to:

1.  comply with all applicable _Data Protection Law_ in the _Processing_ of _Controller Personal Data_; and

2.  not _Process_ _Controller Personal Data_ other than on the relevant _Controller Company_'s written instructions, unless _Processing_ is required by law, in which case the _Processor_ or _Subprocessor_ agrees to give the _Controller Company_ notice of the legal requirement before _Processing_, if the law permits.

## Instruction to Process

Each _Controller Company_ instructs _Processor_, and authorizes _Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ to instruct each of their _Subprocessors_, to _Process_ _Controller Personal Data_ and transfer _Controller Personal Data_ to any country or territory as necessary for the provision of the _Services_, consistent with the _Services Agreement_.

## Legal Instruction Warranty

Each _Controller Company_ states that it is and will be legally authorized to give the instruction in [Instruction to Process](#Instruction_to_Process).

## Required Information

[Processing Summary](#Processing_Summary) sets out information required by _GDPR_ 28(3). _Controller_ can make amendments to [Processing Summary](#Processing_Summary) by written notice to _Processor_ as necessary to meet similar requirements of other _Data Protection Law_. Nothing in [Processing Summary](#Processing_Summary) confers any right or imposes any obligation on any party to this addendum.

# Personnel

_Processor_ agrees to:

1.  answer for breaches of this addendum by its _Personnel_, and _Personnel_ of any _Subprocessor_, with access to _Controller Personal Data_;

2.  limit access to _Controller Personal Data_ to _Personnel_ who need access for purposes of the _Services Agreement_, or to comply with _Data Protection Law_; and

3.  ensure that all _Personnel_ with access to _Controller Personal Data_ have obligations to keep them confidential under contracts, professional obligations, or legal requirements.

# Security

_Processor_ agrees to implement the security measures listed in [Security Measures](#Security_Measures) for the protection of _Controller Personal Data_.

# Subprocessing

## Appointing Subprocessors

Each _Controller Company_ authorizes _Processor_ to appoint _Subprocessors_, and each of the _Subprocessors_ to appoint _Subprocessors_ in turn, and so on, under [Subprocessing](#Subprocessing) and any restrictions in the _Services Agreement_.

## Current Subprocessors

_Processor_ may continue to use _Subprocessors_ they were using before signing this addendum, as long as those _Subprocessors_ meet the requirements of [Subprocessor Requirements](#Subprocessor_Requirements) as soon as practical.

## Notice and Objection

_Processor_ agrees to give _Controller_ prior written notice of the appointment of any new _Subprocessor_, describing the _Processing_ the _Subprocessor_ will do. If _Controller_ gives _Processor_ notice of a reasonable objection within fourteen calendar days:

1.  _Processor_ agrees to work with _Controller_ to change how it provides the _Services_, to avoid using the new _Subprocessor_.

2.  If _Processor_ cannot make such a change within thirty calendar days, _Controller_ may terminate the _Services Agreement_ to the extent of the _Services_ that require the new _Subprocessor_.

## Subprocessor Requirements

_Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ appointing any new _Subprocessor_ must:

1.  perform adequate due diligence to ensure the new _Subprocessor_ can provide the level of protection for _Controller Personal Data_ required by the _Services Agreement_ and this addendum, before that new _Subprocessor_ _Processes_ any _Controller Personal Data_.

2.  ensure the relationship with the new _Subprocessor_ is governed by a written contract:

    1.  requiring at least the same level of protection for _Controller Personal Data_ as this addendum; and

    2.  meeting the requirements of _GDPR_ 28(3);

3.  ensure the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ are part of the contract with the new _Subprocessor_ at all times while the new _Subprocessor_ _Processes_ _Controller Personal Data_, if the relationship involves any _Restricted Transfer_; and

4.  give the _Controller_ review copies of the contract with the new _Subprocessor_ on request, optionally redacted to remove confidential information not relevant to compliance with this addendum.

## Subprocessor Compliance

_Processor_ agrees to ensure that each _Subprocessor_ will abide by the following sections, as if the _Subprocessor_ were the _Processor_, to the extent they apply to _Processing_ the _Subprocessor_ does:

1.  [Compliant Processing](#Compliant_Processing);

2.  [Personnel](#Personnel);

3.  [Security](#Security);

4.  [Data Subject Rights](#Data_Subject_Rights);

5.  [Data Breach](#Data_Breach);

6.  [Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation](#Impact_Assessment_and_Prior_Consultation);

7.  [Deletion or Return](#Deletion_or_Return); and

8.  [Audit Obligations](#Audit_Obligations).

# Data Subject Rights

1.  _Processor_ agrees to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures listed in [Assistance Responding to Data Subject Rights](#Assistance_Responding_to_Data_Subject_Rights) to help each _Controller Company_ meet its obligation to respond to requests to exercise _Data Subject_ rights under _Data Protection Law_.

2.  _Processor_ agrees to:

    1.  notify _Controller_ promptly if _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ receives a request from a _Data Subject_ under _Data Protection Law_ about _Controller Personal Data_; and

    2.  ensure that the recipient does not respond to that request unless required by _Data Protection Law_, except on written instructions from the _Controller_ or the relevant _Controller Affiliate_.

3.  If _Data Protection Law_ permits, _Processor_ agrees to notify _Controller_ before a _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ responds to a request because they are required to do so by _Data Protection Law_.

# Data Breach

## Data Breach Notice

_Processor_ agrees to notify _Controller_ without undue delay when _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ becomes aware of a _Personal Data Breach_ affecting _Controller Personal Data_. As the information becomes available, _Processor_ agrees to notify _Controller_ of:

1.  the nature of the _Personal Data Breach_;

2.  the estimated categories and number of _Data Subjects_ affected;

3.  the estimated categories and number of _Personal Data_ records affected;

4.  contact information for _Personnel_ who can answer further questions; and

5.  measures taken or planned to address the _Personal Data Breach_.

## Data Breach Cooperation

_Processor_ agrees to cooperate with each _Controller Company_ to investigate, mitigate, and remediate any _Personal Data Breach_.

# Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation

_Processor_ agrees to assist each _Controller Company_ with data protection impact assessments and prior consultations with any _Supervisory Authority_ or other competent data privacy authority required by _GDPR_ 35, _GDPR_ 36, or similar provisions of other _Data Protection Law_, by answering questions about the _Processing_ of _Controller Personal Data_ by _Processor_ and any _Subprocessor_.

# Deletion or Return

## Obligation to Delete

Subject to [Option to Return](#Option_to_Return) and [Data Retention](#Data_Retention), _Processor_ agrees to delete all copies of _Controller Personal Data_, and to require every _Subprocessor_ to delete all copies, within thirty calendar days of the _End of Services_.

## Option to Return

Subject to [Data Retention](#Data_Retention), _Controller_ may give _Processor_ notice within fourteen calendar days of the _End of Services_ that _Processor_ must instead return one complete copy of all _Controller Personal Data_ to _Controller_ by secure file transfer in standard file formats, delete other copies, and require every _Subprocessor_ to delete other copies. _Processor_ agrees to return the copy requested within thirty calendar days of the _End of Services_.

## Data Retention

_Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ may retain _Controller Personal Data_ as required by _Data Protection Law_. _Processor_ and each _Subprocessor_ retaining _Controller Personal Data_ agree to keep them confidential, and to ensure they are only _Processed_ as necessary for purposes required by _Data Protection Law_.

## Certificate of Deletion or Return

_Processor_ agrees to certify to _Controller_ in writing that _Processor_ and all _Subprocessors_ have fully complied with [Deletion or Return](#Deletion_or_Return) within sixty calendar days of the _End of Services_.

# Audit

## Audit Obligations

To the extent information and audit rights under the _Services Agreement_ fall short of what _GDPR_ 28(3)(h) and similar provisions of other _Data Protection Law_ require, _Processor_ agrees to:

1.  provide information on request from any _Controller Company_ to demonstrate compliance with this addendum; and

2.  grant access for, and cooperate with, audits and inspections of compliance with this addendum by any _Controller Company_ or _Controller Company_ auditor.

## Audit Procedure

### Notice of Audit

Each _Controller Company_ agrees to give _Processor_ prior written notice of any audit or inspection under [Audit Obligations](#Audit_Obligations).

### Minimize Disruption

Each _Controller Company_ agrees to ensure that _Controller Company_ _Personnel_ and auditor _Personnel_ take reasonable steps to avoid and minimize damage, injury, and disruption to the premises, equipment, personnel, and business of _Processor_ and every _Subprocessor_.

### Audit Limits

Neither _Processor_ nor any _Subprocessor_ has to give access for an audit or inspection:

1.  to anyone without reasonable evidence of identity or authority;

2.  outside normal business hours, unless the _Controller Company_ performing the audit gave prior notice that the audit or inspection needs to be conducted on an emergency basis; or

3.  more than once per calendar year, not counting audits or inspections for which the _Controller Company_ mentions in its notice that:

    1.  the _Controller Company_ considers the audit necessary because of concerns about compliance with this addendum;

    2.  _Data Protection Law_ requires the _Controller Company_ to perform the audit; or

    3.  a _Supervisory Authority_ or similar regulatory authority responsible for enforcing _Data Protection Law_ requests or requires the _Controller Company_ to perform the audit.

# Restricted Transfers

## Standard Contractual Clauses

Subject to [Standard Contractual Clauses Apply Only if Necessary](#Standard_Contractual_Clauses_Apply_Only_if_Necessary), each _Controller Company_ (as data exporter) and _Processor_ (as data importer) agree to the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ for any _Restricted Transfer_ from _Controller Company_ to _Processor_, substituting [Processing Summary](#Processing_Summary) for appendix 1 and [Security Measures](#Security_Measures) for appendix 2 to the _Standard Contractual Clauses_.

## Standard Contractual Clauses Apply Only if Necessary

[Standard Contractual Clauses](#Standard_Contractual_Clauses) applies to a _Restricted Transfer_ only if necessary, together with other practical compliance steps, short of getting _Data Subjects_' consent, to make the relevant _Restricted Transfer_ legal under _Data Protection Law_.

# General Terms

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Other than under the "Mediation and Jurisdiction" and "Governing Law" clauses of the _Standard Contractual Clauses_, the dispute resolution, venue, and forum provisions of the _Services Agreement_ apply to this addendum.

## Order of Precedence

### Standard Contractual Clauses Trump this Addendum

Where this addendum and the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ conflict, the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ take precedence.

### No Effect on Services Agreement Scope

Nothing in this addendum reduces any _Processor_ data protection obligations under the _Services Agreement_ or permits _Processor_ to _Process_ or allow _Processing_ of _Personal Data_ in any way the _Services Agreement_ prohibits.

### This Addendum Trumps Other Agreements

Subject to [No Effect on Services Agreement Scope](#No_Effect_on_Services_Agreement_Scope), where this addendum conflicts with other agreements between the parties, such as the _Services Agreement_, signed before or after this addendum, this addendum takes precedence.

## Changes in Data Protection Law

### Amendments for Compliance

_Controller_ may amend the _Standard Contractual Clauses_ as required by a change in _Data Protection Law_, or a court or regulator decision under _Data Protection Law_, to allow _Restricted Transfer_ to continue without breaching _Data Protection Law_. _Controller_ must give _Processor_ notice thirty calendar days in advance.

### Amendments to Address New Risks

If _Controller_ gives notice under [Amendments for Compliance](#Amendments_for_Compliance), _Controller_ agrees not to unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any amendments to this addendum proposed by _Processor_ to protect _Processor_ or any _Subprocessor_ from additional risks posed by the amendment to the _Standard Contractual Clauses_.

### Good Faith Negotiation

If _Controller_ gives notice under [Amendments to Address New Risks](#Amendments_to_Address_New_Risks), the parties agree to negotiate amendments to address the requirements identified in _Controller_'s notice in good faith, as soon as practical.

### Amendment without Affiliates

Neither _Controller_ nor _Processor_ needs the consent or approval of any _Affiliate_ to amend this addendum, including under [Amendments to Address New Risks](#Amendments_to_Address_New_Risks).

## Severance

The parties intend that:

1.  any part of this addendum held invalid or unenforceable be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable;

2.  any part of this addendum that cannot be changed to make it enforceable be disregarded; and

3.  the rest of this addendum remains in force, unless that frustrates the essential purpose of this addendum: to meet the requirements of _Data Protection Law_ for _Processing_ of _Controller Personal Data_ as part of the _Services_.
